# HapticFeedbackScanner
Object scanner with haptic feedback

# How to make
- Wire the circuit as shown below
- Download and install Arduino IDE at https://arduino.cc/en/software
- Install Simple Kalman Filter Library by denyssene (https://github.com/denyssene/SimpleKalmanFilter) from Arduino Library Manager
- Compile and upload the code to the Arduino

# Wiring
Currently the circuit is wired as shown below:

# TODO
- Improve stability
- Add mode switch to switch between distance range - DONE
- Add Motion detection function - if possible - DONE

# Note
*This project is in its early stage, so do expect bugs to show up at any given time*
